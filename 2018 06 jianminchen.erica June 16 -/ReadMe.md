Sudoku solver<br>

Work on algorithm with a JavaScript programmer from Sillicon Valley - 
Very good experience to explain the algorithm and also write the code. [Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/Mock-interviews/blob/master/jianminchen.erica%20June%2016%20-/BST%20Successor%20Search.cs) is the link.

Work on sudoku solver algorithm. <br>
I rewrote the code after the mock interview since the code got lost. I like the practice, no compiler error or no run time error in the code writing. <br>

Line 47, set function return type using IEnumerable<char> instead of HashSet<char>. 
In mock interview, I am not sure if HashSet<char> has Remove API or not. 

Time spent to rewrite: Less than 20 minutes

Need to study HashSet<> class source code and memorize all APIs<br>

I learned how to write a C# minimum heap using SortedDictionary today when I worked on Leetcode 23 Merge k sorted lists. So I wrote a new version K messes sorted array using minimum heap.
