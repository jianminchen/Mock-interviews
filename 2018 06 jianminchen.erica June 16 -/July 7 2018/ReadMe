I have two mock interview on July 7, 2018. 

First one is to work on the algorithm called pair with specific difference. 

Second one is to work on the algorithm called Merge 2 packages. 

I also had chance to give out count island to the peer, and asked intended algorithms on this algorithm. I did exactly same thing the peer gave to me one week before. 

First the extended algorithm is to using hashmap to store those random island nodes and then visit its neighors.

Second one is to count islands every time the new node is added as island nodes.

Island count II - I wrote a blog on this algorithm. [Here](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/09/one-day-vacation-island-count-ii.html) is the blog.  <br>
