# Mock-interviews
I like to document my mock interview practices in C#, so I can track what I have achieved in problem solving skills. Please refer to my blog about mock interview in detail, here is the link: http://juliachencoding.blogspot.ca/2018/04/10-rounds-of-mock-interviews.html

The folder containing all algorithms is jianminchen.sh Sept 7 - Nov 20 2017. I will check in my practice for each round later.
