#Array Index & Element Equality

Given an array of sorted distinct integers named arr, write a function that returns an index i in arr for which arr[i] = i or -1 if no such index exists.

Implement the most efficient solution possible, prove the correctness of your solution and analyze its runtime complexity (in terms of n - the length of arr).

Examples:

Given arr = [-8,0,2,5] the function returns 2, since arr[2] = 2
Given arr = [-1,0,3,6] the function returns -1, since no index in arr satisfies arr[i] = i
