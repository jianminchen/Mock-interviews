#Island Count

Given a 2D matrix M, filled with either 0s or 1s, count the number of islands of 1s in M. An island is a group of adjacent values that are all 1s. Every cell in M can be adjacent to the 4 cells that are next to it on the same row or column.

Explain and code the most efficient solution possible and analyze its runtime complexity.

Example: the matrix below has 6 islands:

    0  1  0  1  0
    0  0  1  1  1
    1  0  0  1  0
    0  1  1  0  0
    1  0  1  0  1
