Keep a journal. I got this advice from tennis sports training. 

I have so much fun to read those practice code I did for Sudoku solver back in 2015. I cannot keep laughing after three years. Life is such a great teacher. I learn to be patient to allow myself to make so many smells in the code and do not know how to clean it back in 2015. Have some humor and have some fun to look at my own work back three years ago.
