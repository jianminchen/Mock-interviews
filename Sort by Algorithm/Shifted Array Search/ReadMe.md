I like to review binary search algorithm, and also like to put all 10 rounds mock interview practice together for me to review. 

I was asked to work on the algorithm on August 20, 2019 - onsite interview in California, MPK. I like to review my past practice, and see what I should work on next. 

[Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/discuss/365301/C-various-practices-in-2019) is the link to show my various practice in 2019.
